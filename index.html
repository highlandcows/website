				The first question I get when people come to my web site is, "Why Highland Cows?"
			</p>
			<p class="intro">
				It's actually not that complicated.  Highland Cows was a company that I started
				some years ago when I was doing some contract work for a friend.  When that gig wound down,
				I still felt attached to the domain so I've kept it for my professional prescence on the web.
			</p>
			<h2 class="intro">What I Do</h2>
			<p class="intro">
				I'm a coder with 30+ years experience in the technology industry, the bulk of that in
				financial services.  I'm currently working for a payments for small businesses start-up
				in Cape Town, <a href="https://yoco.co.za">Yoco Technologies</a>.
