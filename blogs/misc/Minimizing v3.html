<h1>Minimizing... Simplifying...</h1>

<p>There's lots of focus on decluttering our lives. Digital detox, digital minimalism. Our lives are immersed in this new medium, this virtual world. All too soon, we sense that it is not the perfect place that we imagined it to be. Something just doesn't feel right about it.</p>

<p>So here's my take. In the past 15 or so years, we have developed a brilliant intersection of technologies that has enabled industrial techniques to stimulate our minds and our emotions, in other words, the one thing that is a most distinctly human capability. More than any other organ in our bodies, our brains are the center of every drive, the source of every action, the very soul of every emotion we feel, good or bad. Specifically, smartphones have become a Trojan horse of commerce and consumption guiding and often recording our innermost thoughts and most intimate moments in our lives. While these devices can be a positive force in our lives, they often are not. We simultaneously praise the coupling of technology and rampant capitalism while cursing it for minimizing our fragile existence in the physical world. </p>

<p>We crave this newly created technology because its use makes us feel affirmed, makes us feel connected to others. But does it really? Despite the feelings that it provokes in us, engagement with the digital world leaves us feeling dissatisfied, empty, and often wondering what attracted us to it in the first place.</p>

<p>I've become increasingly interested in this issue because I've experienced some of the effects of mobile phone addiction even though or perhaps because I work in technology. I realized that simply being aware of the techniques that are used by technology companies in the past 10-15 years is not sufficient to prevent obsessive behaviors.</p>

<p>As I became more knowledgeable about this issue, I harkened back to a subject for which my fascination began in late high school: Eastern philosophy and Buddhism in particular. More on that later.</p>

<h2>My journey to digital minimalism</h2>

<p>My first portable electronic devices were dedicated music players such as the Sony Walkman. In time, my portable music players went from cassette to digital — I received as a Christmas present a first-generation iPod nano which lead me to Apple's products in the 2000's. Working in technology, I carried a pager that morphed into a Blackberry phone, but those were devices which, as far as I was concerned, were for work. </p>

<p>The point is that these devices were, largely speaking, single-purpose devices. I didn't pick up my iPod nano and wish that I could surf the web with it. So while I found the idea of carrying a portable phone that included the functionality of computer and a camera intriguing, it wasn't intriguing enough that I queued up to get an iPhone when it was released in 2007.</p>

<p>I didn't get a smartphone of my own until late 2013. The nail in the coffin was Qualcomm's <a href="https://youtu.be/N9Y_naTHPsY">commercial</a> for their Snapdragon CPU and when I saw that Sony's Xperia Z1 used that processor, I was instantly seduced by its beautiful lines of aluminum and glass. But by late 2016, having left the corporate world and now working for a start-up in Cape Town, I began to feel that my phone was a bit too omnipresent in my life. Like many other people, I saw that it had become my go-to distraction. </p>
<div class="page-break" style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

<p>Around that time, I read Tristan Harris' widely publicized essay, <em>How Technology is Hijacking Your Mind — from a Magician and Google Design Ethicist</em>, and was very taken by what he had written in it. Harris' article resonated with me and so my first step was to delete social networking apps from my phone: both personal and professional. It made sense. I also read <em>How To Break Up With Your Phone</em>, a well-written guidebook on how to reduce the amount of time you spend with your phone.</p>

<p>But even after reading and trying to apply their recommendations, I still found it hard to let go of using my phone as a source of distraction. As I read these works, I couldn't help but think about another place I had heard a similar message of how to disconnect and let go. It was back in my university days when I had avidly studied Buddhism and Zen Buddhism in particular.</p>

<h2>Minimalism: Where it began for me</h2>

<p>In my early teen years I studied music seriously and it was through music that I was introduced to minimalism in art. I think my initial attraction to minimalism came about in large part because of its novelty. But there was something more. Minimalism presents a fascinating paradox: it presents itself in the guise of simplicity but the more we ponder it, the more we realize that there is an expressiveness that speaks directly to our minds. Thus I came to appreciate 20th century composers who sought to strip their works of over-burdened harmonies, orchestrations, and instead expressed musicality in a stripped down form. It didn't matter whether it was Schoenberg, Shostakovich, Miles Davis, or The Sex Pistols. These musicians eschewed unnecessary ornamentation in their works and it was here that I was most at home. </p>

</div>

<p>Thus, when I noticed one of my classmates reading <em>The Dancing Wu Li Masters</em> by Gary Zukav, my imagination was ignited by its discussion of high-energy particle physics interleaved with discussions of the duality of existence. It was here that I had my first real introduction to Eastern philosophy and having previously only been exposed to Western, Judaeo/Christian thinking, I was fascinated by its paradoxical and esoteric concepts.</p>

<p>I continued my study of Buddhism in university and there I read <em>The Diamond Sutra</em>. In this sutra, we are presented with a dialogue between the Buddha and one of his disciples. Through it, we are shown that our mundane understanding of the universe is based on false constructs of self and existence. Works like this were at the basis of a later form of Buddhism popularized in China and Japan: Zen.</p>

<p>Minimalism is a cornerstone of Zen philosophy. Like <em>The Diamond Sutra</em>, its powerful use of paradox, encourages the student to abandon unnecessary ideas and modes of thought as a means of ascertaining the true nature of the universe. It places a high value on experiential thinking and has been greatly prized by people in all walks of life trying to simplify, be they samurai of old, monks, artists, or laypersons. Most importantly, it gives you a vehicle to let go of unnecessary complication in your life.</p>

<p>It was with Zen that I sought to better understand martial arts. It is with a Zen mind that I try to understand sailing each time I go out on the water. It is with Zen that I try to better understand life. Surely, I thought, it can be used to better understand technology.</p>

<h2>Applying minimalism</h2>

<p>At the heart of my issue with my phone was the sense that it had become too omnipresent in my life. I recently read a great <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/a-phone-setup-that-will-make-you-more-mindful-1c5d8be7e661">Medium article</a> by <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/@ngoeke">Niklas Göke</a> in which he observed that &quot;Your toothbrush is the embodiment of mindfulness&quot;. Humorous or not, there is a kind of lean truth to this. We need to view our phones as tools. A powerful means to an end that serves <em>our</em> needs and not some corporate quarterly results. We should not be <em>their</em> tools.</p>

<p>In summary, we should be focused on lives in which we connect to other people. There are so many ways to connect, be it in person or virtually, but there is no question that our phones are immensely powerful in enabling this act. We should seek to personalize those connections. Obviously when we meet in person, we satisfy that need. But also consider that you can make communication to many people a personal experience, too. For example, when you read a well-written book or article, even though it is unlikely that the author was specifically thinking about you when they wrote it, we get a sense of joy or pleasure from reading that content nevertheless. So electronic communication need not be impersonal.</p>

<p>And so it should be with our phones. I have found that when I use my phone for connecting with people, whether it be just to speak to them or to help a customer or a colleague, I forget about the fact that I'm using this beautiful, seductive thing of glass and metal. I just focus on the other person.</p>

<p>The point is that what I learned from Buddhism and Zen is completely applicable here. Right thinking, right speaking, and right actions lead us to focus on human-centered interactions. As long as those values remain at the forefront of my use of technology, I have a vehicle, a framework for using technology that serves my needs. I think that if everyone adopts these human-centered ideas, we'll find that a lot of other life challenges will become more manageable, too.</p>
